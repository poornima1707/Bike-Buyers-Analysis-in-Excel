# Bike Buyers Analysis in Excel

This project demonstrates a complete analysis workflow in Excel, focusing on data cleaning, data preparation, and dashboard creation. Using a dataset of bike buyers.

## Project Overview

This project was developed to showcase essential data cleaning and dashboard creation techniques in Excel. The final deliverable is an interactive dashboard that visualizes insights from the bike buyers dataset, including income, gender, marital status, and age categories.

### Key Steps

1. **Data Exploration and Setup**:
   - Import the bike buyers dataset.
   - Create separate sheets for raw data, the working (cleaned) dataset, pivot tables, and the final dashboard.
   - Include columns such as ID, marital status, gender, income, education, and bike purchase status.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Remove duplicate entries.
   - Standardize abbreviations for clarity:
     - Replace "M" and "S" in the marital status column with "Married" and "Single."
     - Replace "M" and "F" in the gender column with "Male" and "Female."
   - Format the income column for consistency.

3. **Creating Age Brackets**:
   - Add a new column called **Age Brackets** and use nested `IF` statements to classify ages:
     - `Adolescent` (30 and below)
     - `Middle Age` (31â€“54)
     - `Old` (55 and above)

4. **Pivot Tables and Dashboard Creation**:
   - Use pivot tables to analyze data and create visualizations.
   - Generate insights such as average income by gender and bike purchase status.
   - Design an interactive dashboard using Excel's pivot table functionalities and filters for easy data exploration.

## Final Dashboard

The dashboard includes:
   - Visualizations of bike purchases by demographic factors.
   - Interactive filters for deeper analysis.
   - Summarized insights into buyer demographics and purchasing behavior.
